The app has been reworked. Instead of having YouTube videos and chat directly
in the app, it's now designed to work in conjunction with the regular YouTube
app while using LiveTL in split screen or picture-in-picture (PiP) mode to
view filtered chat messages.

The app now requires Android 8.0 or higher.
